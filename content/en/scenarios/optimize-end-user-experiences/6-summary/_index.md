In this workshop, we learned the following:

* How to create simple synthetic tests so that we can quickly begin to understand the availability and performance of our application
* How to understand what RUM shows us about the end user experience, including specific user sessions
* How to write advanced synthetic browser tests to proactively test our most important user actions
* How to visualize our frontend performance data in context with events on dashboards
* How to set up detectors so we don't have to wait to hear about issues from our end users
* How all of the above, plus Splunk and Google's resources, helps us optimize end user experience

There is a lot more we can do with front end performance monitoring. If you have extra time, be sure to play with the charts, detectors, and do some more synthetic testing. Remember our resources such as [Lantern](https://lantern.splunk.com/Observability/UCE/Optimized_experiences), [Splunk Docs](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/rum/intro-to-rum.html), and [experiment with apps for Mobile RUM](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/rum/sample-app.html).

This is just the beginning! If you need more time to trial Splunk Observability, or have any other questions, [reach out to a Splunk Expert](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/contact-us.html).
