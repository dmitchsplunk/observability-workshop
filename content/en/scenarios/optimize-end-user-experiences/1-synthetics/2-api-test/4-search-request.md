Click on {{< button >}}+ Add Request{{< /button >}} to add the next step. Name the step **Search for Tracks named "Up around the bend"**.

Expand the **Request** section and change the request method to **GET** and enter the following URL:

``` text
https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=Up%20around%20the%20bend&type=track&offset=0&limit=5
```

Next, add two request headers with the following key/value pairings:

- **CONTENT-TYPE: application/json**
- **AUTHORIZATION: Bearer {{custom.access_token}}**
  - This uses the custom variable we created in the previous step!
