The [API test](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/synthetics/api-test/api-test.html) provides a flexible way to check the functionality and performance of API endpoints. The shift toward API-first development has magnified the necessity to monitor the back-end services that provide your core front-end functionality.

Whether you're interested in testing multi-step API interactions or you want to gain visibility into the performance of your endpoints, the API Test can help you accomplish your goals.

This excercise will walk through a multi-step test on the Spotify API. You can also use it as a reference to build tests on your own APIs or on those of your critical third parties.
