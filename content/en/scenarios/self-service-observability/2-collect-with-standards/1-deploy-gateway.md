## Gateway

First we will deploy the **OTel Gateway**. The workshop instructor will deploy the gateway, but we will walk through the steps here if you wish to try this yourself on a second instance.

The steps:

* Click the **Data Management** icon in the toolbar
* Click the **+ Add integration** button
* Click **Deploy the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector** button
* Click **Next**
* Select **Linux**
* Change mode to **Data forwarding (gateway)**
* Set the environment to **prod**
* Choose the access token for this workshop
* Click **Next**
* Copy the installer script and run it in the provided linux environment.

Once our gateway is started we will notice... **Nothing**. The gateway, by default, doesn't send any data. It can be configured to send data, but it doesn't by default.

We can review the config file with:

``` bash
sudo cat /etc/otel/collector/splunk-otel-collector.conf
```

And see that the config being used is `gateway_config.yaml`.

|Diagram|What it Tells Us|
|-|-|
|![metrics Config](../images/metrics.png)|**Metrics**:<br>The gateway will receive metrics over **otlp** or **signalfx** protocols, and then send these metrics to **Splunk Observability Cloud** with the **signalfx** protocol.<br><br>There is also a pipeline for **prometheus metrics** to be sent to Splunk. That pipeline is labeled **internal** and is meant to be for the collector. (In other words if we want to receive prometheus directly we should add it to the main pipeline.)|
|![traces Config](../images/traces.png)|**Traces**:<br>The gateway will receive traces over **jaeger**, **otlp**, **sapm**, or **zipkin** and then send these traces to **Splunk Observability Cloud** with the **sapm** protocol.|
|![logs Config](../images/logs.png)|**Logs**:<br>The gateway will receive logs over **otlp** and then send these logs to 2 places: **Splunk Enterprise (Cloud)** (for logs) and **Splunk Observability Cloud** (for profiling data).<br><br>There is also a pipeline labeled **signalfx** that is sending **signalfx** to **Splunk Observability Cloud**; these are events that can be used to add events to charts, as well as the process list.|

We're not going to see any host metrics, and we aren't send any other data through the gateway yet. But we do have the **internal** metrics being sent in.

You can find it by creating a new chart and adding a metric:

* Click the **+** in the top-right
* Click **Chart**
* For the signal of Plot A, type `otelcol_process_uptime`
* Add a filter with the + to the right, and type: `host.id:<name of instance>`

You should get a chart like the following:
![Chart of gateway](../images/gateway_metric_chart.png)

You can look at the **Metric Finder** to find other internal metrics to explore.

## Add Metadata

Before we deploy a collector (agent) let's add some metada onto metrics and traces with the gateway. That's how we will know data is passing through it.

The [attributes processor](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/opentelemetry/components/attributes-processor.html) let's us add some metadata.

``` bash
sudo vi /etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml
```

Here's what we want to add to the processors section:

``` yaml
processors:
  attributes/gateway_config:
    actions:
      - key: gateway
        value: oac
        action: insert
```

And then to the pipelines (adding `attributes/gateway_config` to each):

``` yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [jaeger, otlp, smartagent/signalfx-forwarder, zipkin]
      processors:
      - memory_limiter
      - batch
      - resourcedetection
      - attributes/gateway_config
      #- resource/add_environment
      exporters: [sapm, signalfx]
      # Use instead when sending to gateway
      #exporters: [otlp, signalfx]
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics, otlp, signalfx, smartagent/signalfx-forwarder]
      processors: [memory_limiter, batch, resourcedetection, attributes/gateway_config]
      exporters: [signalfx]
      # Use instead when sending to gateway
      #exporters: [otlp]
```

And finally we need to restart the gateway:

``` bash
sudo systemctl restart splunk-otel-collector.service
```

We can make sure it is still running fine by checking the status:

``` bash
sudo systemctl status splunk-otel-collector.service 
```

## Next

Next, let's deploy a collector and then configure it to this gateway.
