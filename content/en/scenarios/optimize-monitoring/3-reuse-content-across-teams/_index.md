In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, where hybrid and cloud environments are becoming the norm, the need for effective monitoring and troubleshooting solutions has never been more critical. However, managing the elasticity and complexity of these modern infrastructures poses a significant challenge for teams across various industries. One of the primary pain points encountered in this endeavor is the inadequacy of existing monitoring and troubleshooting experiences.

Traditional monitoring approaches often fall short in addressing the intricacies of hybrid and cloud environments. Teams frequently encounter slow data visualization and troubleshooting processes, compounded by the clutter of bespoke yet similar dashboards and the manual correlation of data from disparate sources. This cumbersome workflow is made worse by the absence of monitoring tools tailored to ephemeral technologies such as containers, orchestrators like Kubernetes, and serverless functions.
