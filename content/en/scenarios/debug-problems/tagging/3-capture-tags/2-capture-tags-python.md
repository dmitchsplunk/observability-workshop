Let's add some tags to our traces, so we can find out why some customers receive a poor experience from our application.

## Identify Useful Tags

We'll start by reviewing the code for the `credit_check` function of `creditcheckservice` (which can be found in the `/home/splunk/workshop/tagging/creditcheckservice-py/main.py` file):

```` python
@app.route('/check')
def credit_check():
    customerNum = request.args.get('customernum')

    # Get Credit Score
    creditScoreReq = requests.get("http://creditprocessorservice:8899/getScore?customernum=" + customerNum)
    creditScoreReq.raise_for_status()
    creditScore = int(creditScoreReq.text)

    creditScoreCategory = getCreditCategoryFromScore(creditScore)

    # Run Credit Check
    creditCheckReq = requests.get("http://creditprocessorservice:8899/runCreditCheck?customernum=" + str(customerNum) + "&score=" + str(creditScore))
    creditCheckReq.raise_for_status()
    checkResult = str(creditCheckReq.text)

    return checkResult
````

We can see that this function accepts a **customer number** as an input.  This would be helpful to capture as part of a trace.  What else would be helpful?

Well, the **credit score** returned for this customer by the `creditprocessorservice` may be interesting (we want to ensure we don't capture any PII data though).  It would also be helpful to capture the **credit score category**, and the **credit check result**.

Great, we've identified four tags to capture from this service that could help with our investigation.  But how do we capture these?

## Capture Tags

We start by adding importing the trace module by adding an import statement to the top of the `creditcheckservice-py/main.py` file:

```` python
import requests
from flask import Flask, request
from waitress import serve
from opentelemetry import trace  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP
...
````

Next, we need to get a reference to the current span so we can add an attribute (aka tag) to it:

```` python
def credit_check():
    current_span = trace.get_current_span()  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP
    customerNum = request.args.get('customernum')
    current_span.set_attribute("customer.num", customerNum)  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP
...
````

That was pretty easy, right?  Let's capture some more, with the final result looking like this:

```` python
def credit_check():
    current_span = trace.get_current_span()  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP
    customerNum = request.args.get('customernum')
    current_span.set_attribute("customer.num", customerNum)  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP

    # Get Credit Score
    creditScoreReq = requests.get("http://creditprocessorservice:8899/getScore?customernum=" + customerNum)
    creditScoreReq.raise_for_status()
    creditScore = int(creditScoreReq.text)
    current_span.set_attribute("credit.score", creditScore)  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP

    creditScoreCategory = getCreditCategoryFromScore(creditScore)
    current_span.set_attribute("credit.score.category", creditScoreCategory)  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP

    # Run Credit Check
    creditCheckReq = requests.get("http://creditprocessorservice:8899/runCreditCheck?customernum=" + str(customerNum) + "&score=" + str(creditScore))
    creditCheckReq.raise_for_status()
    checkResult = str(creditCheckReq.text)
    current_span.set_attribute("credit.check.result", checkResult)  # <--- ADDED BY WORKSHOP

    return checkResult
````

## Redeploy Service

Once these changes are made, let's run the following script to rebuild the Docker image used for `creditcheckservice` and redeploy it to our Kubernetes cluster:

```` bash
./5-redeploy-creditcheckservice.sh
````

## Confirm Tag is Captured Successfully

After a few minutes, return to **Splunk Observability Cloud** and load one of the latest traces to confirm that the tags were captured successfully (hint: sort by the timestamp to find the latest traces):

**![Trace with Attributes](../../images/trace_with_attributes.png)**

Well done, you've leveled up your OpenTelemetry game and have added context to traces using tags.

Next, we're ready to see how you can use these tags with **Splunk Observability Cloud**!
