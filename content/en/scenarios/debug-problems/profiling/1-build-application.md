## Introduction

For this workshop, we'll be using a Java-based application called `The Door Game`.  It will be hosted in Kubernetes.

## Pre-requisites

You will start with an EC2 instance and perform some [initial steps](#initial-steps) in order to get to the following state:

* Deploy the **Splunk distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector**
* Deploy the MySQL database container and populate data
* Build and deploy the `doorgame` application container

## Initial Steps

The initial setup can be completed by executing the following steps on the command line of your EC2 instance.

You'll be asked to enter a name for your environment.  Please use `profiling-workshop-yourname` (where `yourname` is replaced by your actual name).

``` bash
cd workshop/profiling
./1-deploy-otel-collector.sh
./2-deploy-mysql.sh
./3-deploy-doorgame.sh
```

## Let's Play The Door Game

Now that the application is deployed, let's play with it and generate some observability data.

Get the external IP address for your application instance using the following command:

```` bash
kubectl describe svc doorgame | grep "LoadBalancer Ingress"
````

The output should look like the following:

```` text
LoadBalancer Ingress:     52.23.184.60
````

You should be able to access The Door Game application by pointing your browser to port 81 of the provided IP address.  For example:

```` text
http://52.23.184.60:81
````

You should be met with The Door Game intro screen:

Click `Let's Play` to start the game:

Did you notice that it took a long time after clicking `Let's Play` before we could actually start playing the game?   

Let's use **Splunk Observability Cloud** to determine why the application startup is so slow.
