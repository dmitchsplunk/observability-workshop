The next chart type that can be used with logs is the **Log View** chart type. This chart will allow us to see log messages based on predefined filters.

As with the previous Log Timeline chart, we will add a version of this chart to our Customer Health Service Dashboard:

{{% notice title="Info" style="green" title="Exercise" icon="running" %}}

* After the previous exercise make sure you are still in **Log Observer**.
* The filters should be the same as the previous exercise, with the time picker set to the **Last 15 minutes** and filtering on severity=error, `sf_service=paymentservice` and `sf_environment=[WORKSHOPNAME]`.
* Make sure we have the header with just the fields we wanted.
* Click again on **Save** and then **Save to Dashboard**.
* This will again provide you with the Chart creation dialog.
* For the **Chart name** use **Log View**.
* This time Click {{% button style="blue" %}}Select Dashboard{{% /button %}} and search for the Dashboard you created in the previous exercise. You can start by typing your initials in the search box (**1**).
