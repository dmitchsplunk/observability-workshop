### Prerequisites

- Proficiency in editing YAML files using `vi`, `vim`, `nano`, or your preferred text editor.
- Supported Environments:
  - A provided Splunk Workshop Instance (preferred). Outbound access to port `2222` is required for `ssh` access.
  - Apple Mac (Apple Silicon). Installation of `jq` is required - [**https://jqlang.org/download/**](https://jqlang.org/download/)

{{% notice title="Exercise" style="green" icon="running" %}}

**Create a directory**: In your environment create a new directory and change into it:

``` bash
mkdir advanced-otel-workshop && \
cd advanced-otel-workshop
```

We will refer to this directory as `[WORKSHOP]` for the remainder of the workshop.

{{% notice title="Remove any existing OpenTelemetry Collectors" style="warning" %}}
If you have completed the Splunk IM workshop, please ensure you have deleted the collector running in Kubernetes before continuing. This can be done by running the following command:

``` bash
helm delete splunk-otel-collector
```

The EC2 instance in that case may also run some services that can interfere with this workshop , so run the following command to make sure they are stopped if present:

``` bash
kubectl delete ~/workshop/apm/deployment.yaml
```

**Download workshop binaries**: Change into your `[WORKSHOP]` directory and download the OpenTelemetry Collector, Load Generator binaries and setup script:

{{% notice style="warning" title="macOS Users" icon="desktop" %}}
Before running the binaries on macOS, you need to remove the quarantine attribute that macOS applies to downloaded files. This step ensures they can execute without restrictions.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash { title="Remove Quarantine Attribute"}
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine otelcol && \
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine loadgen
```

**Update file permissions**: Once downloaded, update the file permissions to make all files executable:

```bash
chmod +x otelcol loadgen setup-workshop.sh && \
./otelcol -v && \
./loadgen --help && \
./setup-workshop.sh
```
-->

Run the `setup-workshop.sh` script which will configure the correct permissions and also create the initial configurations for the **Agent** and the **Gateway**:

<!--
{{% notice note %}}
Having access to [**jq**](https://jqlang.org/download/) is recommended (installed by default on Splunk workshop instances). This lightweight command-line tool helps process and format JSON data, making it easier to inspect traces, metrics, and logs from the OpenTelemetry Collector.
