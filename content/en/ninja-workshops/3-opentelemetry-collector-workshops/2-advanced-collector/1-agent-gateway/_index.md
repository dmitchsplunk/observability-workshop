Welcome! In this section, we’ll begin with a fully functional OpenTelemetry setup that includes both an **Agent** and a **Gateway**.

We’ll start by quickly reviewing their configuration files to get familiar with the overall structure and to highlight key sections that control the telemetry pipeline.

Throughout the workshop, you’ll work with multiple terminal windows. To keep things organized, give each terminal a unique name or color. This will help you easily recognize and switch between them during the exercises.

We will refer to these terminals as: **Agent**, **Gateway**, **Loadgen**, and **Test**.

1. Create your first terminal window and name it **Agent**. Navigate to the directory for the first exercise `[WORKSHOP]/1-agent-gateway` and verify that the required files have been generated:

    ```bash
    cd 1-agent-gateway
    ls -l
    ```
  
2. You should see the following files in the directory. If not, re-run the `setup-workshop.sh` script as described in the **Pre-requisites** section:

    ```text { title="Directory Structure" }
    .
    ├── agent.yaml
    └── gateway.yaml
    ```
<!--
3. Check the contents of the **agent.yaml** file. This file outlines the core structure of the OpenTelemetry Collector as deployed in **Agent** mode:

    ```bash
        cat ./agent.yaml
    ```

4. You will see a pre-configured setup tailored for this workshop:

### Understanding the Agent configuration

Let’s review the key components of the `agent.yaml` file used in this workshop. We’ve made some important additions to support metrics, traces, and logs.

#### Receivers

The `receivers` section defines how the **Agent** ingests telemetry data. In this setup, three types of receivers have been configured:

* **Host Metrics Receiver**

  ```yaml
  hostmetrics:                         # Host Metrics Receiver
    collection_interval: 3600s         # Collection Interval (1hr)
    scrapers:
      cpu:                             # CPU Scraper
  ```

  Collects CPU usage from the local system every hour. We’ll use this to generate example metric data.

* **OTLP Receiver (HTTP protocol)**

  ```yaml
  otlp:                                # OTLP Receiver
    protocols:
      http:                            # Configure HTTP protocol
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4318"       # Endpoint to bind to
  ```

  Enables the agent to receive metrics, traces, and logs over HTTP on port `4318`.  This is used to send data to the collector in future exercises.

* **FileLog Receiver**

  ```yaml
  filelog/quotes:                      # Receiver Type/Name
    include: ./quotes.log              # The file to read log data from
    include_file_path: true            # Include file path in the log data
    include_file_name: false           # Exclude file name from the log data
    resource:                          # Add custom resource attributes
      com.splunk.source: ./quotes.log  # Source of the log data
      com.splunk.sourcetype: quotes    # Source type of the log data
  ```

  Enables the agent to tail a local log file (`quotes.log`) and convert it to structured log events, enriched with metadata such as `source` and `sourceType`.

#### Exporters

* **Debug Exporter**

  ```yaml
    debug:                               # Exporter Type
      verbosity: detailed                # Enabled detailed debug output
  ```

* **OTLPHTTP Exporter**

  ```yaml
    otlphttp:                            # Exporter Type
      endpoint: "http://localhost:5318"  # Gateway OTLP endpoint  
  ```

  The `debug` exporter sends data to the console for visibility and debugging during the workshop while the `otlphttp` exporter forwards all telemetry to the local **Gateway** instance.

  **This dual-export strategy ensures you can see the raw data locally while also sending it downstream for further processing and export.**
