**Single Sign-On (SSO)**
Single Sign-on (SSO) is configured between the Splunk Data Management service (‘SCS Tenant’) and Splunk Cloud environments, so if you already logged in to your Splunk Cloud stack you should automatically be logged in to Splunk Data Management service. If you are prompted for credentials, use the credentials provided in the Splunk Cloud Stack on Splunk Show event (listed under the ‘Splunk Cloud Stack’ section.)
