In this section you will review the Kubernetes Audit Logs that are being collected. You can see that the events are quite robust, which can make charting them inefficient. To address this, you will create an Ingest Pipeline in Ingest Processor that will convert these events to metrics that will be sent to Splunk Observability Cloud. This will allow you to chart the events much more efficiently and take advantage of the real-time streaming metrics in Splunk Observability Cloud.

You should now see the Kubernetes Audit Logs for your environment. Notice that the events are fairly robust. Explore the available fields and start to think about what information would be good candidates for metrics and dimensions. Ask yourself: What fields would I like to chart, and how would I like to be able to filter, group, or split those fields?
