This hands-on workshop teaches you how to monitor Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) using the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector. You'll deploy a PHP/Apache application with a load generator to trigger auto-scaling events and observe the complete scaling lifecycle.

Through practical exercises, you'll explore OpenTelemetry Receivers, Kubernetes Namespaces, ReplicaSets, and HPA mechanics while monitoring everything in Splunk Observability Cloud. You'll master the Kubernetes Navigator, build custom dashboards, analyze metrics and events, and configure detectors to alert on scaling activities.

For this workshop, Splunk has prepared an Ubuntu Linux instance in AWS/EC2 all pre-configured for you.

To get access to the instance that you will be using in the workshop, please visit the URL provided by the workshop leader.
