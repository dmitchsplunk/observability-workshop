Now that our LLM is up and running, we'll add the Prometheus receiver to our 
OpenTelemetry collector to gather metrics from it. 

## Capture the NVIDIA DCGM Exporter metrics 

The NVIDIA DCGM exporter is running in our OpenShift cluster. It 
exposes GPU metrics that we can send to Splunk. 

To do this, let's customize the configuration of the collector by editing the 
`otel-collector-values.yaml` file that we used earlier when deploying the collector. 

Add the following content, just below the `kubeletstats` section: 

``` yaml
      receiver_creator/nvidia:
        # Name of the extensions to watch for endpoints to start and stop.
        watch_observers: [ k8s_observer ]
        receivers:
          prometheus/dcgm:
            config:
              config:
                scrape_configs:
                  - job_name: gpu-metrics
                    scrape_interval: 10s
                    static_configs:
                      - targets:
                          - '`endpoint`:9400'
            rule: type == "pod" && labels["app"] == "nvidia-dcgm-exporter"
```

This tells the collector to look for pods with a label of `app=nvidia-dcgm-exporter`. 
And when it finds a pod with this label, scrape the `/v1/metrics` endpoint using port 9400. 

To ensure the receiver is used, we'll need to add a new pipeline to the `otel-collector-values.yaml` file
as well.  

Add the following code to the bottom of the file: 

``` yaml
    service:
      pipelines:
        metrics/nvidia-metrics:
          exporters:
            - signalfx
          processors:
            - memory_limiter
            - batch
            - resourcedetection
            - resource
          receivers:
            - receiver_creator/nvidia
```

Before applying the changes, let's add one more Prometheus receiver in the next section. 

## Capture the NVIDIA NIM metrics

The `meta-llama-3-2-1b-instruct` LLM that we just deployed with NVIDIA NIM also 
includes a Prometheus endpoint that we can scrape with the collector.  Let's add the 
following to the `otel-collector-values.yaml` file, just below the receiver we added earlier: 

``` yaml
          prometheus/nim-llm:
            config:
              config:
                scrape_configs:
                  - job_name: nim-for-llm-metrics
                    scrape_interval: 10s
                    metrics_path: /v1/metrics
                    static_configs:
                      - targets:
                          - '`endpoint`:8000'
            rule: type == "pod" && labels["app"] == "meta-llama-3-2-1b-instruct"
```

This tells the collector to look for pods with a label of `app=meta-llama-3-2-1b-instruct`.
And when it finds a pod with this label, scrape the `/v1/metrics` endpoint using port 8000.

There's no need to make changes to the pipeline, as this receiver will already be picked up 
as part of the `receiver_creator/nvidia` receiver. 

## Add a Filter Processor 

Prometheus endpoints can expose a large number of metrics, sometimes with high cardinality. 

Let's add a filter processor that defines exactly what metrics we want to send to Splunk. 
Specifically, we'll send only the metrics that are utilized by a dashboard chart or an 
alert detector. 

Add the following code to the `otel-collector-values.yaml` file, after the exporters section 
but before the receivers section:

``` yaml
    processors:
      filter/metrics_to_be_included:
        metrics:
          # Include only metrics used in charts and detectors
          include:
            match_type: strict
            metric_names:
              - DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_FREE
              - DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED
              - DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_TEMP
              - DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL
              - DCGM_FI_DEV_MEM_CLOCK

              - request_prompt_tokens
              - request_generation_tokens
```

Ensure this processor is included in the pipeline we added earlier to the 
bottom of the file: 

``` bash
    service:
      pipelines:
        metrics/nvidia-metrics:
          exporters:
            - signalfx
          processors:
            - memory_limiter
            - filter/metrics_to_be_included
            - batch
            - resourcedetection
            - resource
          receivers:
            - receiver_creator/nvidia
```

## Verify Changes 

Before applying the configuration changes to the collector, take a moment to compare the 
contents of your modified `otel-collector-values.yaml` file with the `otel-collector-values-with-nvidia.yaml` file. 
Update your file as needed to ensure the contents match.  Remember that indentation is important 
for `yaml` files, and needs to be precise. 

## Update the OpenTelemetry Collector Config 

Now we can update the OpenTelemetry collector configuration by running the 
following Helm command: 

``` bash
helm upgrade splunk-otel-collector \
  --set="clusterName=$CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --set="environment=$ENVIRONMENT_NAME" \
  --set="splunkObservability.accessToken=$SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --set="splunkObservability.realm=$SPLUNK_REALM" \
  --set="splunkPlatform.endpoint=$SPLUNK_HEC_URL" \
  --set="splunkPlatform.token=$SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN" \
  --set="splunkPlatform.index=$SPLUNK_INDEX" \
  -f ./otel-collector/otel-collector-values.yaml \
  -n otel \
  splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector
```

## Confirm Metrics are Sent to Splunk 

Navigate to the [Cisco AI Pod](https://app.us1.signalfx.com/#/dashboard/GvmWJyPA4Ak?startTime=-15m&endTime=Now&variables%5B%5D=K8s%20cluster%3Dk8s.cluster.name:%5B%22rosa-test%22%5D&groupId=GvmVcarA4AA&configId=GuzVkWWA4BE) 
dashboard in Splunk Observability Cloud.  Ensure it's filtered on your OpenShift cluster name, and that 
the charts are populated as in the following example:
