Now that our OpenShift cluster is up and running, let's deploy the
OpenTelemetry Collector, which gathers metrics, logs, and traces 
from the infrastructure and applications running in the cluster, and 
sends the resulting data to Splunk Observability Cloud. 

## Deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector

First, we'll create a new project for the collector and switch to that project:

```bash
oc new-project otel 
```

Ensure Helm is installed: 

``` bash 
sudo apt-get install curl gpg apt-transport-https --yes
curl -fsSL https://packages.buildkite.com/helm-linux/helm-debian/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://packages.buildkite.com/helm-linux/helm-debian/any/ any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```

Add the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes' Helm chart repository:

```bash
helm repo add splunk-otel-collector-chart https://signalfx.github.io/splunk-otel-collector-chart
````

Ensure the repository is up-to-date:

```bash
helm repo update
````

Review the file named `./otel-collector/otel-collector-values.yaml` as we'll be using it 
to install the OpenTelemetry collector. 

Set environment variables to configure the Splunk environment you'd like 
the collector to send data to: 

``` bash
export ENVIRONMENT_NAME=<which environment to send data to for Splunk Observability Cloud>
export SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token for Splunk Observability Cloud> 
export SPLUNK_REALM=<your realm for Splunk Observability Cloud i.e. us0, us1, eu0, etc.>
export SPLUNK_HEC_URL=<HEC endpoint to send logs to Splunk platform i.e. https://<hostname>:443/services/collector/event> 
export SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN=<HEC token to send logs to Splunk platform> 
export SPLUNK_INDEX=<name of index to send logs to in Splunk platform>
```

Then install the collector using the following command:

```bash
helm install splunk-otel-collector \
  --set="clusterName=$CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --set="environment=$ENVIRONMENT_NAME" \
  --set="splunkObservability.accessToken=$SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --set="splunkObservability.realm=$SPLUNK_REALM" \
  --set="splunkPlatform.endpoint=$SPLUNK_HEC_URL" \
  --set="splunkPlatform.token=$SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN" \
  --set="splunkPlatform.index=$SPLUNK_INDEX" \
  -f ./otel-collector/otel-collector-values.yaml \
  -n otel \
  splunk-otel-collector-chart/splunk-otel-collector
```

Run the following command to confirm that all of the collector pods are running: 

````
oc get pods

NAME                                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
splunk-otel-collector-agent-58rwm                             1/1     Running   0          6m40s
splunk-otel-collector-agent-8dndr                             1/1     Running   0          6m40s
splunk-otel-collector-k8s-cluster-receiver-7b7f5cdc5b-rhxsj   1/1     Running   0          6m40s
````

Confirm that you can see the cluster in Splunk Observability Cloud by navigating to 
Infrastructure Monitoring -> Kubernetes -> Kubernetes Pods and then filtering on your 
cluster name:
