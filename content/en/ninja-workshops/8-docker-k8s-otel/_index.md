In this workshop, you'll get hands-on experience with the following: 

* Practice deploying the collector and instrumenting a .NET application with the Splunk distribution of OpenTelemetry .NET in Linux and Kubernetes environments.
* Practice “dockerizing” a .NET application, running it in Docker, and then adding Splunk OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
* Practice deploying the Splunk distro of the collector in a K8s environment using Helm.  Then customize the collector config and troubleshoot an issue.

The workshop uses a simple .NET application to illustrate these concepts.  Let's get started!
