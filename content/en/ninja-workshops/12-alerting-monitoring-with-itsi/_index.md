# Workshop: Monitoring and Alerting with Splunk IT Service Intelligence

This hands-on workshop is designed specifically for anyone looking to effectively demonstrate and position the combined power of Splunk Enterprise, AppDynamics, Splunk Observability Cloud, and Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI). Participants will gain practical experience integrating these platforms, focusing on real-world scenarios and use cases that resonate with potential clients. The workshop emphasizes translating technical capabilities into business value, enabling Solution Architects to confidently showcase how these solutions address critical customer challenges.


## Introduction and Overview

In today's complex IT landscape, ensuring the performance and availability of applications and services is paramount.  This workshop will introduce you to a powerful combination of tools – Splunk, AppDynamics, Splunk Observability Cloud, and Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) – that work together to provide comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

### The Challenge of Modern Monitoring

Modern applications often rely on distributed architectures, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.  This complexity makes it challenging to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues or outages.  Traditional monitoring tools often focus on individual components, leaving gaps in understanding the overall health and performance of a service.

### The Solution: Integrated Observability

A comprehensive observability strategy requires integrating data from various sources and correlating it to gain actionable insights.  This workshop will demonstrate how Splunk, AppDynamics, Splunk Observability Cloud, and ITSI work together to achieve this:

* **AppDynamics:**  Provides deep Application Performance Monitoring (APM).  It instruments applications to capture detailed performance metrics, including transaction traces, code-level diagnostics, and user experience data.  AppDynamics excels at identifying performance bottlenecks *within* the application.

* **Splunk Observability Cloud:** Offers full-stack observability, encompassing infrastructure metrics, distributed traces, and logs. It provides a unified view of the health and performance of your entire infrastructure, from servers and containers to cloud services and custom applications. Splunk Observability Cloud helps correlate performance issues across the entire stack.

* **Splunk:**  Acts as the central platform for log analytics, security information and event management (SIEM), and broader data analysis.  It ingests data from AppDynamics, Splunk Observability Cloud, and other sources, enabling powerful search, visualization, and correlation capabilities.  Splunk provides a holistic view of your IT environment.

* **Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI):**  Provides service intelligence by correlating data from all the other platforms.  ITSI allows you to define services, map dependencies, and monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that reflect the overall health and performance of those services.  ITSI is essential for understanding the *business impact* of IT issues.

## Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

*   Articulate the complementary value proposition of Splunk, AppDynamics, Splunk Observability Cloud, and Splunk IT Service Intelligence within a comprehensive observability strategy.
*   Confidently demonstrate the integration points between these platforms, highlighting data flow and correlation capabilities.
*   Create and configure basic alerts in Splunk Enterprise, AppDynamics, and Splunk Observability Cloud showcasing practical alerting scenarios.
*   Build and present compelling demonstrations of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) creation and alerting in Splunk ITSI, emphasizing service-centric monitoring.
*   Explain and demonstrate the value of episodes in Splunk ITSI for improved incident management and reduced MTTR.
*   Translate technical features into business outcomes, focusing on ROI and addressing specific customer pain points.
